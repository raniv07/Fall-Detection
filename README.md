# Fall-Detection using Multimodal data

#Introduction

In this project, we propose a fall detection system that combines sensor and camera data
using a concatenation model to improve the accuracy of fall detection. We extract features
from both sensor and camera data and use a feature selection technique to identify the most
relevant features for each type of data. Our proposed system uses a Random Forest classifier
to take advantage of the unique information provided by each type of data. We aim to
explore additional feature extraction techniques, investigate the impact of different types of
sensors and cameras, and evaluate the effectiveness of real-time fall detection in future work.
Our goal is to develop a reliable and accurate fall detection system that can improve the
safety and well-being of older adults at risk of falling.
